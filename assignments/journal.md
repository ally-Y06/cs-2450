//2450 Journal//

I mainly worked on RobotWarz and learned about making it. I also learned about security, but other than that not much is new.

//11-14-25//
I made a mandelbrot and learned about deploying a container to AWS, putting a site on the internet.

//11-7-25//
I learned how to put selenium tests into github actions with a yml file. Remember that if it's not working, print out messages so you can see if it's something silly blocking it from working like timeago not installing...

//10-29-25//
I learned about making images with coordinate planes in C++, and how it's different from rows and columns because of the way up/down works and there is negatives.

//10-23-25//
I learned how to use selenium to make unit tests and accessing css selectors with it. You can use classes, ids, names, and more to get specific elements. 

//10-16-25//
I learned about tinydb from documentation, like how to enter and modify the values being stored. It's basically a python dictionary but you use query and search.

//10-8-25//
I learned about pair programming and callback functions (which have similar functionality to buttons because they allow events).

//9-30-25//
I learned more about and worked on C++ overloaded operators. Using "this->" can help track where a function is coming from. 

//9-26-25//
This week I did a PPM menu in C++, so I learned how to add a .in file (./ppm_menu < input.in). I also had it read a .ppm file that I converted from a .png, and printed out ascii art of my dog. 

//9-15-25//
I learned more git commands that allow you to make branches in 2450. git checkout -b new-branch then git add, commit, and push. You make a pull request and merge it on Github (don't merge your own branches).

//9-8-25//
I learned about class inheritance in C++. This is the format: "class ChildClass : public InheritedClass"

//9-5-25//
This week I did vectors in C++. Note to remember: image vector is height*width*3 because there is 3 channels for every pixel.

//9-3-25//
I finished up a probablility simulation of 5 card hand odds for CS2100. Also my group and I came up with some ideas for the 2450 project.

//8-28-25//
I got my Github repo set up and ready for class. I've also been trying to figure out the grader on Github for 3005. -edit- I got it working
